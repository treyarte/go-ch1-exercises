# Go Chapter 1 Exercises

A repo for chapter 1 exercises from the The Go Programming Language book by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan.

## Exercises

### exercise 1-1:

Modify the echo program to also print os.Args[0], the name of the command
that invoked it.

### exercise 1-2:

Modify the echo program to print the index and value of each of its arguments, one per line.

### exercise 1-3:

Experiment to measure the difference in running time between our potentially inefficient versions and the one last uses strings.Join. (Section 1.6 illustrates part of the time package, and Section 11.4 shows how to write benchmark tests for systematic performance evaluation.)

### exercise 1-4:

Modify dup2 to print the names of all files in which each duplicated line occurs.
